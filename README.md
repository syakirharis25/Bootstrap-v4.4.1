## 1. Introduction.
<img src="bootstrap.png" height="150"> 
Bootstrap is an open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS. Quickly prototype your ideas or build your entire app with our Sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system, extensive prebuilt components, and powerful plugins built on jQuery. <br /><br />

Bootstrap, originally named Twitter Blueprint, was developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter as a framework to encourage consistency across internal tools. Before Bootstrap, various libraries were used for interface development, which led to inconsistencies and a high maintenance burden.

After a few months of development by a small group, many developers at Twitter began to contribute to the project as a part of Hack Week, a hackathon-style week for the Twitter development team. It was renamed from Twitter Blueprint to Bootstrap, and released as an open source project on August 19, 2011. It has continued to be maintained by Mark Otto, Jacob Thornton, and a small group of core developers, as well as a large community of contributors.

The most prominent components of Bootstrap are its layout components, as they affect an entire web page. The basic layout component is called "Container", as every other element in the page is placed in it. Developers can choose between a fixed-width container and a fluid-width container.

## 4. Using Bootstrap in offline mode.
To use Bootstrap in offline mode, go to https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/download/, under the heading `Compiled CSS and JS` click the **[ Download ]** button with purple line border under the text `This doesnâ€™t include documentation, source files, or any optional JavaScript dependencies (jQuery and Popper.js).`

After downloaded the `bootstrap-4.4.1-dist.zip` file, extract it by right hand click your mouse and then click `Extract All...`, then hit **[ Enter ]** on your keyboard. 

Find the location of the extracted `bootstrap.min.css` file inside the extracted folder under `bootstrap-4.4.1-dist\bootstrap-4.4.1-dist\css`, drag and drop the `bootstrap.min.css` file into your active browser like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox browser. Copy and paste address shown on the address bar on your browser into your text file editor like Microsoft Visual Code. 

Find the location of the extracted `bootstrap.min.js` file inside the extracted folder under `bootstrap-4.4.1-dist\bootstrap-4.4.1-dist\js`, drag and drop the `bootstrap.min.js` file into your active browser like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox browser. Copy and paste address shown on the address bar on your browser into your text file editor like Microsoft Visual Code.

Example of the project HTML file with working offline mode Bootstrap.
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">

    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="file:///C:/Users/username/Desktop/bootstrap-4.4.1-dist/bootstrap-4.4.1-dist/css/bootstrap.min.css">
    <script type="text/javascript" src="file:///C:/Users/username/Desktop/bootstrap-4.4.1-dist/bootstrap-4.4.1-dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>

    <title>Offline Bootstrap mode</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
```

Then refresh your bootstrap file on your browser to see whether it is working or not. Refer to `How to Use Bootstrap Offline or Locally - Step By Step` YouTube video made by **_Reecry_**; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60F6paVpZCs for better explanation.
